<!-- 
  This file will NOT include a <head> tag because it is going to be included in the 
  file `projects.html`. Since this is the case, we do not need to include meta or head information
  such as the title for this page!

  The reason this is not included directly in `projects.html` is tha would over clutter the code. 
  No changes in opening and closing the modal, just a different way of organizing the content.
  
  This is perfectly VALID html. See here:
